# SELM Architecture Overview

## 1. Lightweight Architecture
- **Streamlined Transformer:** SELM employs a streamlined Transformer architecture, optimized with advanced attention mechanisms such as Linformer or Performer. This design reduces computational complexity while preserving accuracy.
- **Efficient Embeddings and Tokenization:** Uses carefully selected embedding layers and tokenization methods, such as SentencePiece or Byte Pair Encoding, for memory-efficient processing.

## 2. Optimization Techniques
- **Pruning and Quantization:** Reduces model size and computational demands by eliminating redundant weights and reducing precision.
- **Mixed-Precision Training:** Utilizes a combination of 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point numbers to minimize memory usage and speed up training on compatible hardware.
- **Low-Rank Factorization:** Implements matrix factorization to approximate large weight matrices, reducing overall model complexity.
- **Cache Optimization:** Enhances memory access and cache utilization during inference to optimize performance on limited hardware.

## 3. Dynamic Inference
- **Early Exits and Conditional Compute:** Implements mechanisms that allow the model to make predictions with less computation when possible, improving real-time responsiveness.

## 4. Distributed and Parallel Training
- **Scalable Training:** Supports distributed training across multiple machines, incorporating cache-aware and multi-node optimizations to efficiently handle larger datasets.

## 5. Active Learning
- **Informative Sample Selection:** Integrates active learning strategies to reduce the amount of labeled data required by selecting the most informative examples for training, thereby improving data efficiency.

## 6. Knowledge Graph Integration
- **Context-Aware Intelligence:** Enhances model reasoning with a knowledge graph, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to provide context-aware intelligence and relational learning for tasks such as question answering and summarization.

## 7. Task-Specific Fine-Tuning
- **Adaptive Modules:** Fine-tunes specific modules for various natural language tasks, including text classification, summarization, and question answering, ensuring task adaptability without bloating the base model.

## 8. Automated Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Optuna Integration:** Uses Optuna for automated tuning of model architecture and training parameters to optimize performance.

## 9. Enhanced Summarization
- **Sophisticated Summarization Features:** Incorporates advanced summarization techniques within the SELM architecture to improve text coherence and relevance.

## 10. Chatbot-Specific Features
- **Real-Time Interaction:** Integrates advanced AI chatbot functionalities to facilitate real-time interactions.
- **Chatbot UI Component:** Leverages React components to provide an interactive frontend for chatbot communication.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Includes chatbot-specific evaluation metrics, such as dialogue coherence and user satisfaction, directly in the frontend components.
- **Dynamic Evaluation:** Updates the evaluation process to include fluency and relevance metrics like BLEU scores, precision, recall, and F1 score for enhanced assessment of chatbot responses.

## 11. Advanced Backend Integration
- **Script Integration:** Updates and integrates various backend scripts such as `evaluate.py`, `data_collection.py`, `data_ingestion.py`, and `active_learning.py` for improved functionality and efficiency.
- **Modular and Optimized Code:** Ensures that backend scripts and components are modular and optimized for seamless integration with the frontend and overall architecture.

## 12. Training and Evaluation
- **Frontend Enhancements:** Integrates React components for training and evaluation, including real-time interaction with an advanced AI chatbot.
- **Automated Evaluation:** Incorporates extended evaluation metrics directly into the SELM structure without relying on external API routes.
